## Hints
* Take a look at managed heap, especially over time
* If some type has too high of a count, it is suspicious
* References are not always the causes of leaks. Finalizers can be the culprits too!

# Userful commands
* ``!dumpheap -stat``
* ``!dumpheap -stat -type [type name]``
* ``!dumpheap -type [type name]``
* ``!gcroot [address]``
* ``!finalizequeue`` - list contents of f-reachable and finalization queue
* ``!frq`` (SOSEX) - list contents of f-reachable queue
* ``!finq`` (SOSEX) - list contents of finalization queue
